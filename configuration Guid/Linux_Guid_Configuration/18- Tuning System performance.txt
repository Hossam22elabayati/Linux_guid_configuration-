Tuning system performance : 
-Optimize system performance by selecting a tuning profile managed by the tunned daemon 

(Service or daemon) : tuned 
-> this service under it , a group of profiles , do a tuning to this profiles , choose a profile is sutible to your application or 
service apply by server 

# Can choose profile static or system choose Automatic  (by defaul Automatic)

profiles install service : 
$ yum install tuned 
$yum enable --now tuned.service


#=================================

The performance-boosting profiles include profiles that focus on the following aspects:
• Low latency for storage and network
• High throughput for storage and network
• Virtual machine performance
• Virtualization host performance

#========================================
some profiles can choose it , is depend on use case  : 
- balanced -> ideal for systems that require a compromise between , power saving and performance 
- desktop -> dervied from the balanced profile , provides faster response of interactive applications 
- throughput-performance : Tunes the system for maximuim throughtput 
- latency-performance : ideal for server systems that required low latency at the expense of power consumption 
- network-latency : derived from the latency-performance profile , it enables addtiional network tuning parameters to provide low network latency 
- network-throughput : 
- powersave
- orcale : optimized fot orcale databases loads based on the throughput-performance profile 
- virtual-guest -> if it runs a virtual machine 
- virtual-host  : host for vms 
support more and more if run -> mysql db , webserver apache , nginx , sqlserver 
-aws : optimize aws ec2 instance 

#=======================================
=> have a two ways to manage tuned 
Gui 
cookbit 
cli : 
# return a logs 
$ tuned 
# show a version 
$ tuned -v 

# need a root priviligies to use 

manage a tuned -> 
$ tuned-adm --help 

# list a profiles , list all availiable tunning profiles on your system 
$ tuned-adm list 

// default profile for me , activity now  
$tuned-adm active 

// change to another profile 
$ tuned-adm profile balanced 

// off all tunning use off , off an active profile 
$ tuned-adm off 
$ tuned-adm active
# nothing

// run agian : 
$ tuned-adm profile virtual-guest 

// show a profile information , and what do 
$ tuned-adm profile _info virtual-guest 

// show a recommanded profile to my ststem 
$ tuned-adm recommend 

// put a profile Automatic by the linux system 
$ tuned-adm auto_profile 


Can one profile and mereg between a profiles with command : 

// merge between more than one profile 
$ tuned-adm profile virtual-guest balanced network-latency 
 

// to install a profiles needs in your system 
$ dnf search profiles

-> install a profile to mysql db server 

#=================================================

# show installed or not 
$ yum list tuned

# if not installed -> get no matched 

#===================================================
